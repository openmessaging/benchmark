# The OpenMessaging Benchmark Framework

**Noticeï¼š** We do not consider or plan to release any unilateral test results based on this standard. For reference, you can purchase server tests on the cloud by yourself. 

This repository houses user-friendly, cloud-ready benchmarking suites for the following messaging platforms:

* [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org)
* [Apache RocketMQ](https://rocketmq.apache.org)
* [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/)
* [Apache Pulsar](https://pulsar.apache.org)
* [NATS Streaming](https://nats.io/)
* [Redis](https://redis.com/)
